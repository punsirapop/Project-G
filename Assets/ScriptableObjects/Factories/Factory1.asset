  _Problem: To win the fight is to remain alive! And to remain alive is to have a
    shield! Forging the shield using all metal makes it tougher but also too heavy.
    Selecting some metal to make the shield tough enough while the weight is not
    too much can be solved using the Standard Knapsack Problem (SKP).
