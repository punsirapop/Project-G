  _Description: This is a step where the actual selection occurs. If the algorithm
    decides that the population needs more evolution, <b>the subset of chromosomes
    from a current population will be selected as a parent</b> based on the fitness
    value. Generally, the chromosome with more fitness value should have more chance
    to be selected.
