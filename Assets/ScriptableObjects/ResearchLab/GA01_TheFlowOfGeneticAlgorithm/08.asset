  _Description: Crossover is the process where a pair of parent chromosomes <b>exchange
    part of their information</b> to produce a new pair of offspring. The difference
    between a crossover in the algorithm and a crossover in the living organism is
    that the algorithm replaces a pair of parents with a pair of produced offspring.
    So, the size of the population remains the same.
