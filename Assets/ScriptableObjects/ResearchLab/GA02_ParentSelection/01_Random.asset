  _Description: The simplest method of parent selection is <b>random selection</b>.
    A new pair of parents are randomly selected until the number of selected chromosomes
    is equal to the number of chromosomes in the current population. Since it is
    just a random selection, the fitness value does not affect the chance of survival.
