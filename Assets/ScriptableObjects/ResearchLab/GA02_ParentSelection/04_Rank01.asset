  _Description: The Roulette Wheel selection may be suffered from a problem called
    premature convergence.  This occurs when there is a very high fitness chromosome
    among the low fitness population. The one with high fitness will dominate the
    most area on the wheel. Its chromosome will dominate the later population and
    decrease the diversity of the population which decreases the chance of discovering
    other good chromosomes.
