  _Description: In sexual reproduction, children inherit genetic information from
    their parents. The process called <b>Crossover</b> occurs when a pair of parent's
    chromosomes are lined up. Then the genetic information in the same partitions
    of each parent can be switched across. The result is children that have genetic
    information from both parents.
