  _Description: 'Each organism contains a set of genetic information which will determine
    characteristics of that organism. Those information may varies among the population.


    For
    example, these plants are the same species, but with the variant genetic information,
    their appearances may differ.

    In this case, plant A is taller and has more
    fruits than plant B. The fruit A is yellow and round, but fruit B is green and
    rough.'
