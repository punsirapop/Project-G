  _Description: "Elitism is a technique that helps <b>preserve the elite chromosomes
    with the highest fitness across generations</b> without any change. For example,
    A and B are elite that are preserved. And other 4 chromosomes are selected from
    a whole 6 chromosomes and crossover to reproduce the new population. It improves
    the performance of the algorithm by ensuring the best solution never be destroyed.\r"
