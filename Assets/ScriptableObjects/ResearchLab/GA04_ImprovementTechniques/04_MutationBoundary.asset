  _Description: The boundary mutation is the mutation suit with the numeric chromosome.
    The mutated chromosome will randomly change some of its numeric values. The selected
    value will be randomly changed into a higher or lower random value. Using the
    old value as a boundary for a random new value is the reason it is called boundary
    mutation.
